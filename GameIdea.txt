Project Name: Eon Defense
Type: Generic Tower Defense Game
Theme: ground Terran (human) race vs. robot-aliens; cell-shaded / vector art with shadows (think of space-game video I have)

Over-world: Just an over-world map, which leads to sub-sections that have level listings

A world is a simple 3D rendered model but laid out in 2D tiles: we're going to follow the advance-wars style / RPG maker style
sprite sheet where putting sprites in combinations make inner-corners, outer-corners, etc. All enemies are in 2D sprite sheets.
The art-style will be similar to Dwarf Fortress. Really should be like the Zelda Wind-Waker art-style.

For gameplay, there are arbitrary random enemy mobs with little visible properties and a health and defense bar
Users can translate and pinch-zoom into the world. Users drag-and-drop new buildings, and can single-click to change building
properties. There are 5 towers, each tower going up to 3 levels, and can be given up for cash-back. There are global powers and
upgrades that can be done. Users gain money after a level, and can use that for global upgrades (but never cary over into a game).

Towers:

	1. Gatling Gun: rapid-fire, low hit. Upgrades affect range
	2. Sniper Gun: slow-fire, high hit. Upgrades affect speed
	3. Sludge Shooter: slow-fire, but slows down enemy. Upgrades affect range
	4. AoE Bombs: Throws AoE bombs. Upgrades affect speed (1 at a time up to 3 at a time)
	5. Shock Tower: Shoots a chain-lighting effect. Upgrade the ammount of 

Global Upgrades: (Cary's over unless destroyed in-game)

	1. Auto-Bot Fixer: Up to 2 automated repair devices
	2. Mine Robot: Runs around placing mines (up to 1)
	3. Slow Robot: Runs around and stuns a mob
	4. Default upgrade (same price during the start of a game, BUT upgraded to 2 or 3) (expensive)
